# NYC-Bikesharing

The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in NYC Bike Riding based on gender, day of the week, and other variables using Tableau. 

# Overview of Analysis

The purpose of our project is determining investment worthiness of the bike rental business for a different city. One of the key factors we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in 2019 August gives a idea on when the bikes are rented, length of rentals and most popular times to rent.  Prior to this analysis on Tableau, a change must be made in the csv file to change the column that records the trip duration in seconds to hours, minutes and seconds. The new cvs is uimported onto Tableau and then analyzed.

# Results

Using tableau I created 7 different visulizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration:

- There was a total of 2,344,224 rides in August of 2019.

- Male riders take up around 2/3 of the total riders.

- Most rides last less than 1 hour and even less than 30 minutes.

- Male riders tend to ride for longer than female riders.

- Peak hours for bike riding during the weekdays are early in the morning and after work in the afternoon, but all day during the weekends. However, peak riding hours for male and female riders are the same.
- Thursdays there are the most subscribers riding for both female and male riders. 

A story board was created to visually represent the data that was analyzed:

# Summary

In conclusion, we see that a ridesharing service would be investment worthy because most people who do ride the bikes (at least in NYC) are subscribers, and the number of rides are extremely high. In addition, 5/7 days of the week the rides seem to be pretty often and it is only during the weekend that the rides are less frequent. Two other visualizations one could look into are:
1. Determining the average distance a ride takes using start and end longtitude/latitude, which will help determine the price model of the service
2. Determining whether weekend or weekday has the longest rides
